## FAQs

**Question:  Why Choose Real Device Automation Over PC Browser Automation?**

**Answer:** We prioritize Android automation because social media algorithms have become increasingly sophisticated. Browser-based bots and API-driven tools often expose data such as fingerprints and IPs, leading to quick account bans. In contrast, using multiple Android devices, each running 25‚Äì50 Instagram apps with mobile proxies or SIM data, provides a more secure and effective solution. Real device bots more accurately mimic human behavior and can bypass social media‚Äôs strict detection systems.


**Question:  How Does Social Media Automation Work on Real Devices?**

**Answer:** Our bots run on real Android and iOS devices, using mobile proxies or SIM data to avoid detection. This setup closely mimics human behavior, ensuring better engagement and reducing the risk of being flagged by platforms like Instagram and TikTok.

**Answer:** Yes, we can build bots on any social media platforms, including Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, LinkedIn, or any. We specialize in automating tasks on Android, iOS devices, and emulators,Our solutions are customized to fit your specific needs.
